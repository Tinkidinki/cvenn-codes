%
%    PSI = PURIFICATION(RHO) returns a minimal purification of density matrix
%          RHO. Eigenvalues of RHO smaller than a tolerance of
%
%              tol = length(RHO) * sigma(1) * eps
%
%          are taken to be zero, where sigma(1) is the largest singular
%          value of RHO and eps is the machine precision.
%
%    PSI = PURIFICATION(RHO,TOL) sets the tolerance to TOL.
%
%    [PSI DIM] = PURIFICATION(RHO) returns the dimension of the auxilliary
%    purifying system as DIM.
